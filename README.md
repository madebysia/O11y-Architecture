## 🛠 The Tech Stack: Hybrid Observability
I architect systems that leverage both open-source flexibility and enterprise power:

* **Edge Metrics:** Prometheus & Grafana for real-time Kubernetes cluster visibility.
* **APM & AIOps:** Dynatrace for automated causal analysis and Davis® AI root-cause detection.
* **Log Intelligence:** Splunk for deep-dive forensics, indexing, and Governance/Compliance reporting.
* **Bridge:** OpenTelemetry (OTel) as the unified collection layer to prevent vendor lock-in.
